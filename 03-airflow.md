# DATA LAKE -  Airflow

Airflow is an open-source platform used for workflow orchestration and data pipeline management. It is used for scheduling, monitoring, and maintaining complex data pipelines in a scalable way. Airflow provides an easy-to-use interface that enables data engineers to define workflows as code and execute them on a distributed infrastructure.

When it comes to data lake workflow orchestration, Airflow can be used to manage the entire data pipeline, from ingestion to processing to storage. With Airflow, data engineers can define workflows that include tasks such as:

- Ingestion: Airflow can be used to schedule and execute scripts or workflows that ingest data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or file systems. This data can be transformed, cleaned, or enriched before being stored in the data lake.
- Processing: Airflow can be used to schedule and execute batch or streaming data processing jobs on the ingested data. These jobs can be implemented using tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Apache Beam.
- Storage: Airflow can be used to schedule and execute workflows that store the processed data in the data lake. This data can be stored in various formats, such as Parquet, ORC, Avro, or JSON.
- Monitoring: Airflow provides a dashboard that displays the status of the workflows and tasks. This enables data engineers to monitor the data pipeline and troubleshoot any issues.

The architecture of Airflow for data lake workflow orchestration includes the following components:

- Scheduler: The scheduler is responsible for scheduling and executing the workflows according to the defined schedule.
- Workers: The workers are responsible for executing the tasks defined in the workflows. These tasks can be executed on a distributed infrastructure, such as a Hadoop or Spark cluster.
- Database: Airflow uses a database to store the metadata related to the workflows, tasks, and their status. This database can be a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database, such as Apache Cassandra or MongoDB.
- Web server: The web server provides a web-based UI for managing the workflows, tasks, and their dependencies. It also provides access to the logs and monitoring dashboard.
- Executors: The executors are responsible for executing the tasks defined in the workflows. There are various types of executors available in Airflow, such as SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, and KubernetesExecutor.
- Plugins: Airflow provides a plugin architecture that enables users to extend the functionality of Airflow by writing custom operators, sensors, hooks, and other components.

Overall, Airflow provides a powerful and flexible platform for managing data lake workflows. It enables data engineers to define, execute, and monitor complex data pipelines in a scalable and reliable way.

# Setting up Airflow locally with docker
Airflow can be set up locally using Docker, which makes it easy to create a sandbox environment for testing and development. Here are the steps to set up Airflow locally with Docker:

Install Docker: Install Docker on your local machine by following the instructions provided in the Docker documentation for your operating system.

[![N|Docker Fellowship 9](https://icon-library.com/images/docker-icon/docker-icon-15.jpg)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)



Create a Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in a new directory with the following contents:
```sh
FROM apache/airflow:2.1.2-python3.8

# Install any additional packages here
RUN pip install pandas==1.2.4

# Copy DAGs and plugins to the container
COPY dags/ /opt/airflow/dags/
COPY plugins/ /opt/airflow/plugins/
```
This Dockerfile extends the official Airflow Docker image and installs an additional Python package (pandas) and copies the DAGs and plugins to the container.

Create a Docker Compose file: Create a docker-compose.yml file in the same directory with the following contents:
```sh
version: '3'

services:
  webserver:
    image: my-airflow
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - LOAD_EXAMPLES=no
    volumes:
      - ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags
      - ./plugins:/opt/airflow/plugins
      - ./logs:/opt/airflow/logs
      - ./data:/opt/airflow/data
```
This Docker Compose file defines a service named webserver that uses the Docker image created in step 2. It maps port 8080 to the host machine and mounts several volumes, including the directories for DAGs, plugins, logs, and data.

Build the Docker image: In the directory containing the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files, run the following command to build the Docker image:
```sh
docker-compose build
```
This command will build the Docker image and tag it as my-airflow.

Start Airflow: Run the following command to start the Airflow webserver:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
This command will start the webserver service defined in the docker-compose.yml file and expose the Airflow web UI on port 8080.

Access Airflow UI: Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to access the Airflow web UI. You can log in with the default username and password (airflow and airflow, respectively).

Define DAGs and tasks: You can define DAGs and tasks in the dags/ directory and plugins in the plugins/ directory. Airflow will automatically detect and load these files when the container starts.

With this setup, you can easily test and develop data pipelines using Airflow and Docker, without worrying about installing dependencies or configuring a complex environment.

We can find some image version of Airflow in Docker Hub
