# DATA LAKE -  Airflow

Airflow is an open-source platform used for workflow orchestration and data pipeline management. It is used for scheduling, monitoring, and maintaining complex data pipelines in a scalable way. Airflow provides an easy-to-use interface that enables data engineers to define workflows as code and execute them on a distributed infrastructure.

When it comes to data lake workflow orchestration, Airflow can be used to manage the entire data pipeline, from ingestion to processing to storage. With Airflow, data engineers can define workflows that include tasks such as:

- Ingestion: Airflow can be used to schedule and execute scripts or workflows that ingest data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or file systems. This data can be transformed, cleaned, or enriched before being stored in the data lake.
- Processing: Airflow can be used to schedule and execute batch or streaming data processing jobs on the ingested data. These jobs can be implemented using tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Apache Beam.
- Storage: Airflow can be used to schedule and execute workflows that store the processed data in the data lake. This data can be stored in various formats, such as Parquet, ORC, Avro, or JSON.
- Monitoring: Airflow provides a dashboard that displays the status of the workflows and tasks. This enables data engineers to monitor the data pipeline and troubleshoot any issues.

The architecture of Airflow for data lake workflow orchestration includes the following components:

- Scheduler: The scheduler is responsible for scheduling and executing the workflows according to the defined schedule.
- Workers: The workers are responsible for executing the tasks defined in the workflows. These tasks can be executed on a distributed infrastructure, such as a Hadoop or Spark cluster.
- Database: Airflow uses a database to store the metadata related to the workflows, tasks, and their status. This database can be a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database, such as Apache Cassandra or MongoDB.
- Web server: The web server provides a web-based UI for managing the workflows, tasks, and their dependencies. It also provides access to the logs and monitoring dashboard.
- Executors: The executors are responsible for executing the tasks defined in the workflows. There are various types of executors available in Airflow, such as SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, and KubernetesExecutor.
- Plugins: Airflow provides a plugin architecture that enables users to extend the functionality of Airflow by writing custom operators, sensors, hooks, and other components.

Overall, Airflow provides a powerful and flexible platform for managing data lake workflows. It enables data engineers to define, execute, and monitor complex data pipelines in a scalable and reliable way.
