<b>Data lakes</b><br />

Data lakes have become increasingly popular in recent years because they offer several advantages over traditional data warehousing approaches.<ul>The key reasons why organizations are adopting data lakes:<br />

<li>Store all types of data: Data lakes can store all types of data, structured and unstructured, in its raw form. This includes data from transactional systems, social media, machine data, and more. This flexibility allows organizations to collect and store data from multiple sources without having to worry about data formats or data transformations.</li>

<li>Scalability: Data lakes are designed to scale horizontally, which means that they can handle large volumes of data without performance degradation. This makes it easier for organizations to store and analyze data at scale, without worrying about the limits of their storage infrastructure.</li>

<li>Flexibility: Because data lakes store data in its raw form, it is possible to analyze the data in different ways depending on the organization's needs. This enables a wide range of use cases, including data discovery, data exploration, and advanced analytics.</li>

<li>Agility: With data lakes, organizations can quickly ingest new data sources and store them without having to redesign their data models or schema. This allows organizations to respond quickly to changing business requirements and experiment with new data sources.</li>

<li>Cost-effective: Data lakes can be a cost-effective solution for storing and analyzing large volumes of data. This is because data lakes leverage distributed file systems and open-source technologies, which can be more cost-effective than traditional data warehousing solutions.</li>
</ul>

Overall, data lakes offer a more flexible and scalable approach to data management than traditional data warehousing solutions. This makes them an attractive option for organizations looking to store and analyze large volumes of data, particularly unstructured data, and to gain insights to support data-driven decision-making.
